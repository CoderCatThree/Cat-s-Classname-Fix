If you want a more proper translation of the class names, here ya go. I made this like two or three years ago and was always way too lazy to actually go write a full readme and upload the damn thing. I'm doing it now, and just keeping in some relevant notes about some particular things regarding the translation worth pointing out.

Now CONTEXT! Aethin's English translation patches of TRS and Berwick have a pretty noticeable quirk of inserting Fire Emblem terminology that didn't exist in the original games. Accuracy aside, this results in some really goofy mishaps. Best example is probably how he changed Fighter to Mercenary, but Mercenary was already an existing enemy only class. So he then went and changed THAT class to Sellsword. I made this patch because it bugged the shit out of me. This was done using an old Japanese modding tool called TRSmodify.

IMPORTANT: This is not a full translation patch, nor am I trying to claim Aethin's work or something. You gotta put this thing onto a rom that already has the translation, not a clean one.

ALSO important: There may be some classes which have a blob of spaces next to them. I never bothered fixing the problem because again I was lazy, and am not going to do it at the moment because I am lazy. There shouldn't be any issues beyond this, and its purely graphical. It shouldn't be THAT obnoxious anyway.

Installation: Download Lunar IPS and apply the thing to trs rom that has version 1.04 of aethin's translation patch. 

Lastly, a few little things worth pointing out regarding the contents itself. Wrote this stuff back when I actually made this thing.

- I kept Stealth Hunter because it sounds cooler and works just fine. It communicates the same idea as "Hide Hunter"

- Squire Lord is used because Runan's class was originally "Knight Lord". Knight Lord is distinct from Fire Emblem's Knight Lord class, as in Japanese Fire Emblem's Knight Lord is "Lord Knight". Runan promotes from "Knight Lord" to Lord in japanese, communicating that he is going from just a knight who is an heir to being a full on lord. Since all of this is confusing, I'm changing it to Squire Lord as it communicates the original intent far better. He's just a squire who becomes a full lord.

- Privateer is inaccurate but way funnier so I kept it. The class is literally "Bow Hero" in katakana.

- Changed the class name of Plum and Lyria to be "Priestess". Originally it was just "Priest" in katakana which is weird. Weird because its unique to them and no other unit in the game. Not keeping "Cleric" because that's what the Shaman class is called in Japanese, or rather they use what the "cleric" class is called in japanese Fire Emblem which is "Sister".

-"Opus" (mogall japanese name in TRS) was likely a case if "western word sounds cool in japanese", with "op" referring to eyes.

- Revenant is staying Revenant because its called "Zombie", which is the same as the FE equivalent
